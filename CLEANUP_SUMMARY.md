# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## What Was Cleaned Up

The repository previously had **5+ README/documentation files** with significant redundancy and scattered information. This cleanup consolidated and organized the documentation for better maintainability.

## Files Removed

1. **README-SIMPLE.md** (83 lines) → Consolidated into main README.md
2. **TESTING.md** (155 lines) → Moved to DOCS.md
3. **DISTRIBUTION.md** (193 lines) → Moved to DOCS.md
4. **installer/setup-wizard.md** (39 lines) → Removed (concept document)
5. **installer/** directory → Removed (was empty after cleanup)

## Files Reorganized

1. **README.md** → Enhanced with user-friendly quick start (already improved)
2. **docker/README.md** → Streamlined to focus on advanced Docker configuration only
3. **DOCS.md** → New comprehensive developer documentation file

## Final Documentation Structure

```
├── README.md              # Main user-facing documentation
├── DOCS.md               # Developer/contributor documentation
└── docker/README.md      # Advanced Docker configuration
```

## Benefits of Cleanup

- ✅ **Eliminated redundancy** - No more duplicate installation instructions
- ✅ **Clear separation** - User docs vs developer docs
- ✅ **Single source of truth** - Each topic covered in one place
- ✅ **Easier maintenance** - Changes only need to be made in one location
- ✅ **Better navigation** - Users know exactly where to look

## Maintenance Going Forward
